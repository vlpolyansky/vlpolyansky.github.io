I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. My research is focused on Machine Learning and on applications of computational geometric and topological methods to Artificial Intelligence.

I pursued a Master's degree at KTH on Machine Learning programme, and graduated in 2018.

I graduated with a Bachelor degree at St Petersburg State University (SPb SU, Russia) on Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty, in the sub-department of Analytical Information Systems.
