I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, affiliated with Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP-AI](https://wasp-sweden.org/)). My supervisor is [Florian Pokorny](http://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/).

My research interests lie in the area of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on applications of _geometric and topological methods_ to analyze or improve the methods of machine learning.

I pursued a Master's degree at KTH on Machine Learning programme, and graduated in 2018.

I obtained my Bachelor degree at St Petersburg State University (SPb SU, Russia) on the Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty within the sub-department of Analytical Information Systems.
